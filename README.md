Secure Gallery is a fork of Simple Gallery Pro. It's focus is on ensuring your gallery is as private and secure as possible. I would prefer all these features be merged into Simple Gallery Pro, but it is not the vision of the author and I respect that. Feel free to use my fork and add any features you wish. You can view all the features of Secure Gallery below. Please give thanks to [Simple Gallery Pro](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Gallery).
